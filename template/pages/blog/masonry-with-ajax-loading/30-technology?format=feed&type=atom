If sitting in a room with a trainer and having the opportunity for discussion with other learners sounds good to you then we can offer this. If you have enough people wanting to attend the same course then we can run one just for you. If you prefer to study in your own time and at your own speed then one of our e learning packages may be right up your street. There is a third option, which is like the sound of both but perhaps can’t attend all training sessions, this is when blended learning comes into its own.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
